## Abstract

```
FanTV has built a custom OpenID and wants to whitelist for entire SUI ecosystem to benefit from this feature

```

## Motivation

```
Zk login currently doesn't support mobile number authentication in the SUI ecosystem. Since 90% of our dApp users rely on mobile numbers, this feature is crucial. FanTV has built a custom OpenID solution and seeks to whitelist it for the entire SUI ecosystem to enable zk login using mobile numbers.

```

## Specification

```
FanTV OpenID for Zk login in the SUI ecosystem

```

## Rationale

```
Most apps use mobile numbers for user registration, and 90% of FanTV's users do the same. From a business perspective, it's crucial for the SUI ecosystem to implement this feature to enhance user experience and cater to more users who rely on mobile numbers. Therefore, it's important for us to get our custom OpenID whitelisted.

```

## Backwards Compatibility

```
Yes, it's compatible, just like other existing providers Google, Facebook, and Twitch.
